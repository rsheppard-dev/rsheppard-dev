### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack web developer with a passion for learning new skills to enhance my abilities as well as keeping up-to-date with the latest changes in the tech industry. I specialise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, NextJS and Node.

I have been a student of web development for two years now and have been working as a freelancer helping businesses make bespoke functionality for their websites.

I am currently enrolled in a scholarship program from the Department of Education on HyperionDev's Web Development Bootcamp and I am looking for a full-time role in the tech industry.
